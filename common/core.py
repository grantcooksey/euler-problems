This module contains a collection of common functions that can be reused in
later problems. There is no criteria as to when it is a good idea to transfer
a function from the problem to the core module other than it might be helpful.

    A mathematical approach to calculating the number of digits in a number.
    This method is an alternative to converting the number to a string and
    calculating the length of the string. This method works well when counting
    digits for a large number since converting an int to a string is costly.

        n (int): Number to get the number of digits from

    Returns:
        int: Number of digits in n.
